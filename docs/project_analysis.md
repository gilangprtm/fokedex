      create: (context) => createProvider(),
      child: _OptimizedProviderWidget<T>(
        builder: (context, provider) => builder(context, provider),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class PropertySelector<T extends BaseProvider, U> extends StatelessWidget {
  final String property;
  final U Function(T provider) selector;
  final Widget Function(BuildContext context, U value) builder;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Only rebuilds when the selected property changes
  }
}
```

```dart
class PokemonRepository {
  final _apiClient = ApiClient();

  Future<PaginatedApiResponse<ResourceListItem>> getPokemonList({int offset = 0, int limit = 20}) async {
    // API call logic
  }

  Future<Map<String, dynamic>> getPokemonDetail(String nameOrId) async {
    // API call logic
  }
}
```

#### 4.1.3. `data/datasource/local/`

This directory contains services for local data storage and caching.

**Key Files:**

- **`local_pokemon_service.dart`**: Manages local storage for Pokémon data.

### 4.2. Presentation Layer (`lib/presentation/`)

The presentation layer handles UI components and state management.

#### 4.2.1. `presentation/providers/`

This directory contains provider classes that manage state for UI components.

Example from `pokemon_list_provider.dart`:

```dart
class PokemonListProvider extends BaseProvider {
  final PokemonService _pokemonService = PokemonService();
  final LocalPokemonService _localService = LocalPokemonService();

  // State properties
  List<ResourceListItem> _pokemonList = [];
  bool _isLoading = false;
  String? _activeTypeFilter;

  // Property getters
  List<ResourceListItem> get pokemonList => List.unmodifiable(_pokemonList);
  bool get isLoading => _isLoading;

  // Methods for loading and filtering
  Future<void> loadPokemonList({bool refresh = false}) async {
    // Implementation
  }

  Future<void> _filterByType(String typeName) async {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

#### 4.2.2. `presentation/pages/`

This directory contains UI pages organized by feature.

**Key Structure:**

- Feature-specific subdirectories (`pokemon/`, `location/`, etc.)
- Page implementations (`pokemon_list_page.dart`, `pokemon_detail_page.dart`, etc.)
- Feature-specific widgets in `widgets/` subdirectories

Example from `pokemon_list_page.dart`:

```dart
class PokemonListPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ProviderPage<PokemonListProvider>(
      createProvider: () => PokemonListProvider(),
      builder: (context, provider) => Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Pokémon')),
        body: _buildBody(context, provider),
      ),
    );
  }

  Widget _buildBody(BuildContext context, PokemonListProvider provider) {
    return PropertySelector<PokemonListProvider, bool>(
      property: 'isLoading',
      selector: (provider) => provider.isLoading,
      builder: (context, isLoading) {
        // UI implementation
      },
    );
  }
}
```

#### 4.2.3. `presentation/widgets/`

This directory contains shared widgets used across multiple pages.

#### 4.2.4. `presentation/routes/`

This directory contains route definitions for navigation.

## 5. Architecture

### 5.1. Architectural Pattern

The application follows a modified MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture with clean architecture principles:

- **Model (Data Layer)**: `lib/data/` - Data models, repositories, and services.
- **View (UI Layer)**: `lib/presentation/pages/` - UI components.
- **ViewModel (State Layer)**: `lib/presentation/providers/` - State management.
- **Core (Foundation)**: `lib/core/` - Base classes, utilities, and services.

### 5.2. Data Flow

The application follows a unidirectional data flow:

1. UI triggers an action in the Provider (ViewModel).
2. Provider calls appropriate Service.
3. Service uses Repository for data access.
4. Repository retrieves data from API or local storage.
5. Data flows back through the same path to the UI.

```
UI (Pages) ↔ Providers ↔ Services ↔ Repositories ↔ API/Local Storage
```

### 5.3. Dependency Injection

The application uses a service locator pattern for dependency injection, implemented in `core/di/service_locator.dart`.

## 6. Main Features

- Batch updates to reduce UI rebuilds
- Async operation helpers with error handling
- UI components that rebuild only when necessary

Example from `BaseProvider`:

```dart
void notifyPropertyListeners(String property) {
  if (_isBatchUpdate) {
    _changedProperties.add(property);
    return;
  }

  if (_propertyListeners.containsKey(property)) {
    final listeners = List<VoidCallback>.from(_propertyListeners[property]!);
    for (final listener in listeners) {
      try {
        listener();
      } catch (e, stackTrace) {
        _logger.e('Error in property listener', error: e, stackTrace: stackTrace);
      }
    }
  }

  notifyListeners();
}
```

#### 6.5.2. Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling throughout the application:

- Centralized error handler service
- UI feedback for error states

### 7.6. Analysis

The dependencies are generally up-to-date (as of the analysis date) and follow modern Flutter development practices. The project uses a comprehensive set of packages for different concerns, from networking to UI rendering, without excessive dependencies.

## 8. Code Quality

### 8.1. Naming Conventions

The project follows consistent naming conventions:

- **Files**: snake_case with descriptive suffixes (`pokemon_list_page.dart`, `pokemon_model.dart`)
- **Classes**: PascalCase with descriptive names (`PokemonListProvider`, `TypeChartPage`)
- **Variables**: camelCase with underscores for private members (`_pokemonList`, `_isLoading`)
- **Methods**: camelCase with verbs describing actions (`loadPokemonList()`, `filterByType()`)

### 8.2. Documentation

The code includes documentation in various forms:

- Class-level documentation describing purpose and usage
- Method-level documentation for complex operations
- Inline comments for non-obvious logic
- Structured code with clear sections

Example from `base_provider.dart`:

```dart
/// A base class for all providers in the application that extends [ChangeNotifier].
///
/// This class provides lifecycle methods that are called from [BaseWidget] during
/// widget lifecycle events. It also provides access to the [BuildContext] from the widget.
abstract class BaseProvider extends ChangeNotifier {
  // Implementation...
}
```

### 8.3. Code Organization

The code is well-organized with clear separation of concerns:

- Methods are grouped by functionality
- Related functionality is kept together
- UI components are broken down into manageable pieces
- State logic is separated from UI rendering

### 8.4. Potential Code Smells

Despite overall good quality, there are some potential code smells:

- **Long Methods**: Some provider methods (like `loadPokemonList()`) are quite long and could be broken down further.
- **Duplicate Logic**: Some filtering and loading patterns are repeated across providers.
- **Direct Service Instantiation**: Services are sometimes instantiated directly in providers rather than injected, which can make testing more difficult.

Example of a long method:

```dart
Future<void> loadPokemonList({bool refresh = false}) async {
  // 50+ lines of code for loading, filtering, and state management
}
```

### 8.5. Null Safety

The project appears to be fully null-safe, using modern Dart features:

- Proper use of nullable and non-nullable types
- Null checks where appropriate
- Default values for nullable parameters
- Null-aware operators (`?.`, `??`, `!`)

## 9. Performance and Scalability

### 9.1. Performance Optimizations

The application implements several performance optimizations:

#### 9.1.1. UI Optimization

- **PropertySelector**: Selective UI rebuilds based on specific property changes
- **Batch Updates**: Grouped property notifications to reduce unnecessary rebuilds
- **Cached Network Image**: Efficient image loading with caching
- **Pagination**: Loading data in chunks as needed

Example of PropertySelector:

```dart
PropertySelector<PokemonListProvider, List<ResourceListItem>>(
  property: 'filteredPokemonList',
  selector: (provider) => provider.filteredPokemonList,
  builder: (context, pokemonList) {
    return GridView.builder(
      // Implementation that only rebuilds when filteredPokemonList changes
    );
  },
)
```

#### 9.1.2. Data Optimization

- **Local Caching**: Data is stored locally to reduce network requests
- **Lazy Loading**: Details are loaded only when needed
- **Precomputation**: Complex calculations are performed once and stored

### 9.2. Potential Performance Bottlenecks

Despite optimizations, there are potential performance bottlenecks:

- **Image Loading**: Large number of Pokémon images could cause memory issues
- **Type Filtering**: Current implementation may not scale well with large datasets
- **Evolution Chain Calculation**: Complex evolution relationships might be expensive to compute

### 9.3. Scalability Analysis

The application's architecture supports scalability:

- **Modular Design**: Features are isolated, making it easy to add new ones
- **Abstracted Data Layer**: New data sources can be added with minimal changes
- **Consistent Patterns**: New developers can easily understand and extend the codebase

### 9.4. Suggested Optimizations

To further improve performance and scalability:

- **Implement Virtual Scrolling**: For very large lists of Pokémon
- **Background Data Syncing**: Prefetch data in the background
- **Progressive Image Loading**: Load low-resolution thumbnails first
- **More Granular Property Selectors**: Further reduce unnecessary rebuilds
